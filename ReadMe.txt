What did I attempted/added/deleted:
	-Tuned the paremeters.cs which including the weapons and other adjustable values which including:
			-agentshotgun goal tweaker from .2 to .3
			-agentRailgun  GoalTweaker from .05 to .08
			-shotgun maximum rounds carryied 30 to 19
			-shotgun ideal range 250 to 180
	-Changes above would let the weapon get balanced because shotgun was over powered and the rate for other weapons are too low
	-Added a file called MoveToWall which could let low HP agent to move close to the wall as a cover
	-Added an additional weapon type which called landmine.
	-Improve issues with the frame rate so that the game plays smoothly with 3, 4 or 5 weebles per team.
